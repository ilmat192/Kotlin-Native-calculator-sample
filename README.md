# Calculator sample

This example shows how to use Kotlin common module (located in [parser/src](parser/src/)) in different environments.
Currently for
* iOS (see [calculator](calculator/))
* plain JVM (cli) (see [jvm](jvm/))
* Android (see [android](android/))

## iOS
The iOS project compile the common library to a framework (see [ios](ios/)). The framework can be easily included in an existing iOS project (e.g. written in Swift or Objective-C)

To build and run the iOS sample do the following:

1.  Open `calculator.xcodeproj` with Xcode.
2.  Open the project's target through project navigator, go to tab 'General'.
    In 'Identity' section change the bundle ID to the unique string in
    reverse-DNS format. Then select the team in 'Signing' section.
    
    See the
    [Xcode documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringYourApp/ConfiguringYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH28-SW2)
    for more info.
3.  Now build and run the application with Xcode.

The sample consists of:

1.  Xcode iOS application project, written in Swift. It uses Kotlin library to
    parse simple arithmetic expressions.
2.  Kotlin library source code and build script. It is built into Objective-C
    framework by invoking Gradle from custom "Run Script" build phase, and this
    framework is imported into the Xcode project.

## Plain JVM
The common library can also be compiled to a JVM-application by Kotlin/JVM compiler withÂ Gradle. 
To build and run it, go to [jvm](jvm/) directory and use
```
../gradlew run
```

To build the distribution:
```
../gradlew distZip
```
(the result will be available as
`jvm/build/distributions/KotlinCalculator.zip`)

## Android App
The common library also may be used to build an Android application.

To build and run the Android sample do the following:

1.  Open `android` in Android Studio
2.  Now build and run the androidApp application
